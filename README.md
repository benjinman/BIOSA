##### Authors: Lisa, Conard, Wai, Sheng, Hoi Yan
--------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Description:
The goal of the project is to build the foundation and tools needed to develop and to analyze mutational differences between reference DNA sequences and samples.
Evidences from the input “GenomeDiff” files are utilized to conduct additional computational analysis of experiments that supports mutations.
Additionally, a REST API is provided for database access using the browser, and other applications that need the data.
